Idea is to create as detailed image as possible with visible 1 m elevation differences. 
The scanning data requires some enhancements to look nicer. In this case ground is spread up to 3 px (m) to each direction. 

Laser scan data is from Maanmittauslaitos, scanned in 2022 and downloaded in 2023 from https://asiointi.maanmittauslaitos.fi/karttapaikka/tiedostopalvelu/laserkeilausaineisto_05
